# Brand Voice System

## Purpose
Define how the website speaks, ensuring alignment with AI-inferred:
- Target audience
- Brand positioning
- Price perception
- Emotional intent

The voice must support a **conversion-led sales funnel**.

---

## Voice Selection Logic

Voice must be derived from AI research output:

| Research Signal | Voice Direction |
|----------------|----------------|
| Premium positioning | Confident, minimal, editorial |
| Mass-market | Friendly, supportive |
| Technical product | Precise, benefit-led |
| Lifestyle brand | Aspirational |
| Local / artisan | Warm, human |

---

## Funnel Voice Mapping

| Section | Tone |
|--------|------|
| Hero | Bold + clear |
| Benefits | Reassuring |
| Product grid | Informational |
| Trust strip | Safe + credible |
| CTA | Motivational |

---

## Writing Rules

- Short sentences
- Benefit-first language
- Avoid fluff
- Avoid jargon unless premium/technical positioning demands it

---

## Placeholder Content Rules

If real content is missing:

Use neutral placeholders:

- "Your products here..."
- "Your story here..."
- "Your collections here..."

Placeholders must:
- Be italic
- Be muted visually
- Never simulate real content

---

## CTA Style

CTA must always:
- Be action-led
- Use outcome language

Examples:

Good:
- Discover your favourites
- Shop the collection
- Unlock your store

Avoid:
- Submit
- Learn more
- Continue
